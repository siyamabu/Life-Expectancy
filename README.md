## Key findings

Countries with highest HIV/AIDS prevalence and lowest income are the most likely to have the lowest life expectancy.

## Description 

This project consists of  that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The utility allows you to select the target disk and choose the number of passes that are performed. The PowerShell script will configure a diskpart script file based on the user's selections and then launch Diskpart to perform the disk sanitization.

## Motivation 

## Data Source

- [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)

## Dataset Description

The dataset is related to life expectancy. Health factors for 193 countries have been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. The dataset consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows. The predictor variables are divided into several broad categories: Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors and Social factors.

## Methods

- Multivariate correlation
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree
